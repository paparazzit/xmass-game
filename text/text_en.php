    Christmas around the world is celebrated with many unique and peculiar
    traditions. <br />
    One such tradition comes from Catalonia, in which a cute little log
    poops out gifts for children on Christmas Eve! <br />
    Play a little game to meet Tió de Nadal, the Catalan Christmas Log!
    <br />
    He might have a special gift just for you, if you can figure out what
    you need to do!',
